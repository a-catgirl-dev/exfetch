# exFetch

A fork of [xFetch](https://codeberg.org/pparaxan/xFetch) ([v4](https://github.com/pparaxan/xFetch_v4)) designed to be faster, more maintainable and cross-platform.

## Why?

xFetch's main goal is simplicity, minimalism, and performance. In the performance regard, yeah it's pretty damn fast.

exFetch's main goal is performance, looks, maintainability and to be cross platform.

# Installation
## Arch Linux

<AURHelper> -S exfetch-bin
```

More distributions coming soon!
